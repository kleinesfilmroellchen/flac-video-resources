# Files for the FLAC video series

A collection of files I used for creating the FLAC videos. This is mainly the Manim project and images I can publish here, the script will be added after the third episode when it's finished.

Note that most of the Manim renders weren't directly used. Several Manim bugs had to be worked around during video editing, such as problems with complex sequences where some Mobjects are show prematurely. Additionally, most of the timings are manually done during editing and the `wait()`'s in the scripts are mostly for debugging purposes.
